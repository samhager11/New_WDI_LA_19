# DOM Manipulation & Events Lab

## Introduction

It's getting hot in here; it's about time we make a temperature conversion utility. Create a single page that contains an `<input>` field, a `<button>` and a `<div>`. Using your cunning wit & research techniques, figure out how to convert a user-inputted temperature from F to C, and display it in the `div`.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Make a text field that takes user input
- When a user clicks a button, convert 째F to 째C & display in a `div`

**Bonus:**
- Round your calculations to one decimal degree
- Display both the 째F & 째C in the `div`
- Make a clear button to reset the input
- Convert in both directions
- Convert both on button click & as the user types
- Make it gorgeous
- Display a gentle correction message if a user enters something other than numbers

#### Starter code

Nada. You will make it all yourself, from scratch, young jedi.

#### Deliverable
