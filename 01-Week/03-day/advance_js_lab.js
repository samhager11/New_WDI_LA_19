/*Hi Everyone! As I mentioned, for those of you who are done with 
  the javascript lab as well as last night's homework, both the
  layout exercise and the form exercise, here's a little extra work
  for tonight. This is very challenging and likely will need concepts
  we have not yet covered. If you have time, give it a shot! 
  
  Basically, we are creating a function that checks if a string
  and any of its anagrams is a palindrome. So, if the string is 
  'caa', which contains the anagram 'aca', the function would 
  return true. */

//Here's something to get you started. 

function canBePalindrome(str){
	var answer; 

	/*YOUR CODE HERE*/

	return answer
}

canBePalindrome('caa') // true
canBePalindrom('bensen') // false
